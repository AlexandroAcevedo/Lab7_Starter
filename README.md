1. I would run them within a GithHub action that runs whenever cod is pushed. This allows for automated test to be ran continuously through out development making it so its easier to detect bugs and not end up with broken code. Furthermore, with it being automated, we won't worry about forgetting to run the tests.

3.Snapshot appears to anaylze the page at a specific point in time, whereas Navigation focuses more performance like visual stability/load times. 

4. Three things to improve: add alt for images in product items.
